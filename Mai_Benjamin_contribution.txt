Throughout this project, I've contributed by creating the git for my group. In addition to that, I created the Snake game in Lisp with the original genetic implementation before the newly Hamiltonian Cycle revision. I had to research how to work with SDL2 for the graphics, and how to use openGL in order to start coding the game in Lisp.Also, I contributed to the various parts of the report which include the introduction, the part explaining the manual controls and graphics for the Lisp snake game, experiment, and references. I did face challenges overall mostly with the genetic implementation, because I haven't worked much in this area in the past, so it was very new to me. All the other parts of the game were pretty difficult too, but that was mainly because I had to get used to coding with the syntaxes of this coding language.
