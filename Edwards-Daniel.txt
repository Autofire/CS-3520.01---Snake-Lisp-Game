Right, so I implemented the hamiltonian cycles. Specifically, everything new in
snakehc.lsp (that is, the code below line 291) is mine.

Initially, I implemented a general solution, and though this is technically
correct, it much too slow. It only worked for grids which were around 6x6 in
size. Anything bigger would take forever to compute. when the actual grid is
80x60, it was clearly not viable.  To be complete, it's been left in.

The solution actually used is the calc_grid_cycle function. This function
exploits the fact that we are working with an empty, rectangular grid, and
does a few clever tricks to simplify computation significantly. Unlike the
previous functions, this new one is of my own design.

Also I fixed a bug which made it so that the snake could not be right next to
the left and upper walls.
